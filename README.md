## Introduction 
Many children are afraid of going to the doctor or hospital. To help them feel more comfortable, some universities and hospitals organize a special event called a **Teddy Bear Hospital**. In this project, children bring their favorite stuffed animals — usually teddy bears — to a play hospital. There, medical students act as "teddy doctors" who examine, treat, and care for the toys. This playful experience helps children understand medical procedures in a fun and relaxed way, making future visits to real doctors less scary.

As part of my beginner internship for my computer science studies, I was part of a group that contributed to this project with a technical twist: We built a **fake X-ray machine** for the teddy bears. The idea was to make the experience even more exciting and realistic for the children.

Here is how it works:
- The teddy bear is placed into a white background.
- A picture of the teddy bear is taken.
- Then, using **Stable Diffusion**, an AI image generation model, the photo is transformed into a creative "X-ray image" of the bear.
- The result is shown on a screen and will be available for download through a personalized QR code.

It's just for fun and a great way to introduce children to both medicine and technology in a creative, friendly way.
